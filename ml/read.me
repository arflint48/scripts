this is a handful of scripts i worked on during my undergrad senior thesis when i was learning how to use ml.

all of them have some different things commented out (some of them relating to what the file name indicates they were designed to accomplish) but should be able to be added back in with no problems, i just had it like that from the last time i was working on this project.

these aren't the laterst versions of the scripts i was using either, but i wanted to grab these because this is the section of the project where i was trying to find approaches that could outperform the simple multivariate linear regression we were using.
